# Project-Sarcina

Project Sarcina is a school project where we are creating a website around a delivery robot that can take packages and deliver them to specified locations.

The main goal of the school project was to learn JavaScript though we still learned a bit about HTML and CSS, personaly this is the first time working with JavaScript and therefor there will probably be bugs and the project will be under development for a long time you can freely download the website and try it out for yourself! If you find any bugs or have a idea for a feature let us know! Just open a ticket under the "Issues" tab.

You can also fork this project and learn from it!
