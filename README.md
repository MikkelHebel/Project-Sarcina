# Project Sarcina
Project Sarcina is a school project where we are creating a website around a delivery robot that can take packages and deliver them to specified locations.

The main goal of the school project was to learn JavaScript though we still learned a bit about HTML and CSS, personaly this is the first time working with JavaScript and therefor there will probably be bugs and the project will be under development for a long time you can freely download the website and try it out for yourself! If you find any bugs or have a idea for a feature let us know! Just open a ticket under the "Issues" tab.

You can also fork this project and learn from it!

## Setup
To run the project we used [Replit](http://replit.com) it's a free software hosting site where you can collaborate on projects with your friends! Alternatively you can download the code and run it locally on your own computer.

## Tech Stack
For the frontend we used HTML and CSS. and JavaScript for the backend.
